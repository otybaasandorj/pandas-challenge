In this challenge, we are looking at the city's district-wide standardized test results. Within the district, there are 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students. 7 of the schools are district schools and the other 8 are charter schools. The charter schools have 12,194 students which is significantly less than the district schools which have 26,976 students. This is a summary of the district as a whole and by each school:
